# ugh

this is a parsing expression library for python 3

```

from grammar import Grammar # here we go

class MyGrammar(Grammar, whitespace=[" "], newline=["\n"], start="main"):
    
    @rule()
    def main(self):
        with self.capture("name"):
            self.accept("yes")
            self.newline()

a = MyGrammar.parser()

a.parse("yes\n")

```

it can also compile to cython for about a 2x speedup

unlike other parsing expression libraries, this handles indentation grammars

and i'm working on markdown parser

i haven't worked out exactly how left corner parsing / left recursion will appear yet
